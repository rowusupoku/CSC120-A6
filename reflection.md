- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Inheritance allows you to make cleaner classes and decreaces repetitive code.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
It was most difficult navigativing the hashtable and learning how to iterate through it to print the key and value. 
I would recommend visiting the docs.oracle webpage to look over classes and their methods.
